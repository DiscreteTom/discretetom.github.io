## 并列

- 逻辑线索
  - **and** / also / besides / in addition / furthermore / moreover
  - not A or B
  - similarly / equally / likewise / like / much like / as if / as though
  - for example / such as
  - 冒号
- 否定动词的分类
  - 没有实际伤害（表面掩盖）：mask / belie / veil / disguise / conceal
  - 有实际伤害
    - 完全否定（把原有的东西完全干掉）：disprove / supplant / nullify / obviate / neutralized
    - 不完全否定：diminish / undermine
- 通常句子前后可以找到对应的内容

## 因果

- 和因果类似，只是逻辑线索不通
- 常见逻辑线索
  - 因为：because, since, as, for, now that, in that, due to
  - 所以: so, thus, therefore, hence, consequently, as a result, so...that
  - 条件: if, given, provided, in light of
  - 目的: to, in order to
  - 手段: by, through, via, in way of
- 技巧：因为美国经常宣扬自由市场，所以通常说自由市场都会反对政府干涉

## 递进

- 逻辑线索
  - not only A but also B, not only A but B, not just A but B
  - A as well as B
  - more, especially, excessive, absolute, extraordinary
  - at best, at worst
- 因为递进，所以前后必定有区别。可能是语义的区别，也可能是程度的区别
- 当然，递进前后也不能自相矛盾
